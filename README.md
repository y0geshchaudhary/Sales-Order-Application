# Sales-Order-Application


DESCRIPTION: 

It’s time to try a little functional programming. In this
case, your job will be to develop a very simple Sales Order application using the Clojure language.
REALLY simple. In fact, all it will really do is load data from a series of three disk files. This data will
then form your Sales database. Each table will have a “schema” that indicates the fields inside. So
your DB will look like this:

cust.txt: This is the data for the customer table. The schema is
<custID, name, address, phoneNumber>

An example of the cust.txt disk file might be:
1|John Smith|123 Here Street|456-4567
2|Sue Jones|43 Rose Court Street|345-7867
3|Fan Yuhong|165 Happy Lane|345-4533

Note that no error checking is required for any of the data files. You can assume that they have been
created properly and all fields are present. Each field is separated by a “|” and contains a non-empty
string.

prod.txt: This is the data for the product table. The schema is
<prodID, itemDescription, unitCost>

An example of the prod.txt disk file might be:

1|shoes|14.96

2|milk|1.98

3|jam|2.99

4|gum|1.25

5|eggs|2.98

6|jacket|42.99


sales.txt: This is the data for the main sales table. The schema is
<salesID, custID, prodID, itemCount>

An example of the sales.txt disk file might be:

1|1|1|3

2|2|2|3

3|2|1|1

4|3|3|4

The first record (salesID 1), for example, indicates that John Smith (customer 1) bought 3 pairs of
shoes (product 1). Again, you can assume that all of the values in the file (e.g., custID, prodID) are
valid.

So now you have to do something with your data. You will provide the following menu to allow the
user to perform actions on the data:

*** Sales Menu ***
------------------

1. Display Customer Table

2. Display Product Table

3. Display Sales Table

4. Total Sales for Customer

5. Total Count for Product

6. Exit

Enter an option?

The options will work as follows
1. You will display the contents of the Customer table. The output should be similar to the
following:

1: ["John Smith" "123 Here Street" "456-4567"]

2: ["Sue Jones" "43 Rose Court Street" "345-7867"]

3: ["Fan Yuhong" "165 Happy Lane" "345-4533"]

Note that exact formatting does not matter. You can use commas as separators or round
brackets instead of square brackets. The important thing is that each record lists the ID,
followed by the data associated with the ID. Records should be sorted by ID.

2. Same thing for the prod table (sorted by Product ID)

3. The sales table is a little different. ID values aren’t very useful for viewing purposes, so the
custID should be replaced by the customer name and the prodID by the product description,
as follows:

1: ["John Smith" "shoes" "3"]

2: ["Sue Jones" "milk" "3"]

3: ["Sue Jones" "shoes" "1"]

4: ["Fan Yuhong" "jam" "4"]

Again, the list should be sorted by Sales ID.

4. For option 4, you will prompt the user for a customer name. You will then determine the
total value of the purchases for this customer. So for Sue Jones you would display a result
like:

Sue Jones: $20.90

This represents 1 pair of shoes and 3 cartons of milk (in our simple example).

5. Here, we do the same thing, except we are calculating the sales count for a given product. So,
for shoes, we might have:

Shoes: 4

This represents three pairs for John Smith and one for Sue Jones.

6. Finally, if the Exit option is entered the program will terminate with a “Good Bye” message.
Otherwise, the menu will be displayed again.

So that’s the basic idea. There are a few final points to keep in mind:

1. You do not want to load the data each time a request is made. So before the menu is
displayed the first time, your data should be loaded and stored in appropriate data
structures (you can do this any way that you like).

2. This is a Clojure assignment, not a Java assignment. So Java should not be used for any main
functionality. It might be necessary to use Java classes to convert text to numbers in order
to do the sales calculations, but Java should not be used for much more than that.

3. The I/O in this assignment is trivial. While it is possible to use complex I/O techniques, it is
not necessary to read the text files. Instead, you should just use “slurp”, a Clojure function
that will read a text file into a string. For the input from the user the “read-line” function can
be used.

4. Do not worry about efficiency. There are ways to make this program (both the data
management and the menu) more efficient, but that is not our focus here. I just want you to
use basic functionality to try to get everything working.

5. For production level Clojure development, many programmers use a build automation
framework called leiningen (similar to ant and maven with Java). However, leiningen is
overkill for this assignment and will complicate your life and possibly that of the grader as
well. So I suggest that you do NOT use it for this assignment. Instead, just create your code
and test it directly from the command line.
